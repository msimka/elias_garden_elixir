# UFF Training System Architecture Prompt

**Context**: We have successfully implemented Tank Building methodology for multi-format text converter with hierarchical atomic components, blockchain verification, and Stage 3 optimizations. This provides an excellent training corpus for UFF (UFM Federation Framework).

**Architect Instructions Needed**:

## Training System Specifications

**Model**: UFF deep-seq 6.7B-FP16  
**Training Type**: RL-based with supervised fine-tuning (Claude supervision)  
**Training Domain**: Component building in ELIAS federation and Apemacs ecosystem  

## Training Corpus Available

   - Complete atomic component breakdown
   - Tank Building methodology implementation
   - Success criteria and validation patterns

2. **TIKI Specifications** (`apps/elias_server/priv/converter_specs/multi_format_converter.tiki`)
   - Hierarchical component tree definitions
   - Blockchain verification configurations
   - Federation integration patterns

3. **Atomic Component Implementations**
   - `apps/elias_server/lib/multi_format_converter/atomic_component.ex` - Behavior pattern
   - `apps/elias_server/lib/multi_format_converter/file_operations/*.ex` - Stage 1 components
   - `apps/elias_server/lib/multi_format_converter/content_extraction/*.ex` - Stage 2 components
   - `apps/elias_server/lib/multi_format_converter/optimization/*.ex` - Stage 3 components

4. **Pipeline Orchestration**
   - `apps/elias_server/lib/multi_format_converter/pipeline/converter_orchestrator.ex`

   - Full Stage 3 production CLI (v2.0.0-stage3)

6. **Blockchain Integration**
   - `apps/elias_server/lib/multi_format_converter/blockchain/ape_harmony_rollup.ex`
   - ECDSA verification, Level 2 rollups, UFM federation ready

## Architect Questions

**Please provide specific instructions for**:

1. **Training Data Structure**: How should we format the Tank Building sessions for UFF training?

2. **RL Reward System**: What metrics should UFF optimize for in component building?
   - Component atomicity (single responsibility)
   - TIKI spec compliance
   - Pipeline integration success
   - Blockchain verification compatibility
   - Performance optimization effectiveness

3. **Supervised Fine-tuning Protocol**: How should Claude supervise the fine-tuning process?
   - Code review and correction cycles
   - Architecture validation
   - Best practice enforcement

4. **Training Environment Setup**: 
   - Infrastructure requirements for 6.7B-FP16 model
   - Integration with existing ELIAS federation
   - UFM node deployment for training

5. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Component quality assessment
   - Tank Building methodology adherence
   - Production readiness validation

6. **Continuous Learning Loop**:
   - How to incorporate daily component building sessions
   - Real-time model updates vs batch training
   - Version control for model iterations

## Current Success Metrics from Tank Building

- **100% Stage 1 Success**: All atomic components working and tested
- **100% Stage 2 Success**: Multi-format support without breaking Stage 1
- **100% Stage 3 Success**: Production optimizations fully integrated
- **Real Verification**: Actual file processing (not mocks)
- **Blockchain Ready**: Ape Harmony Level 2 integration operational
- **CLI Production**: v2.0.0-stage3 with full feature set

## Training Objective

**Train UFF to autonomously build hierarchical atomic components following Tank Building methodology, with Claude supervision for quality assurance and architectural guidance.**
