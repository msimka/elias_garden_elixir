## System Architecture Flow

### **Daily Update Cycle**
```
1. Collect user interactions → User Pattern Learning
2. Update micro-LoRA forest → mLoRA concurrent training (with μP transferred HP)
3. Discover new architectures → GFlowNets architecture search
4. Generate enhanced daemon → Daemon Generator
5. Deploy to user devices → Personalized Daemon update
```

### **User Interaction Flow**
```
User: "Movie idea about time travel..."
↓ 
Personalized Daemon (local):
  - Recognizes creative input type
  - Applies user's movie structuring patterns  
  - Stores in personal Tiki hierarchy
  - Uses GFlowNet-generated diverse suggestions
↓
Background sync with full node for LoRA training
```

### **Scaling Architecture**
```
Individual User: 1,000-5,000 micro-LoRAs
Full Node: 30-50 users (30K-250K total adapters)
Federation: 5 full nodes, 100-150 users total
μP Scaling: Hyperparameters tuned once, transferred to all scales
```

## Success Metrics

@ success_criteria
