# Architect Guidance Request: Tiki Language Methodology - Complete System Design

## Context: Advanced Specification, Testing, and Integration System

We need to design a comprehensive Tiki language methodology that serves as the backbone for ELIAS's entire development, testing, and integration pipeline. This goes far beyond traditional documentation - it's a formal specification language with automated capabilities for testing, debugging, and system integration validation.

## The Four-Pillar Tiki System Architecture

### 1. Hierarchical Specification System (.tiki files)
**Problem**: Every ELIAS component needs granular, machine-readable specifications that map directly to code structure.

**Proposed Solution**: Tree-based specification mapping where:
- Every application (e.g., `elias_mail.ex`) has corresponding `elias_mail.tiki` 
- Each function/module/component gets unique ID referencing spec section
- Tree structure: Root → Branches → Leaves, down to most atomic operations
- Example: `elias_mail.tiki` contains specs for `send()`, `get()`, `authenticate()`, `list_files()`, etc.
- Each spec section has ID that directly maps to code blocks

**Questions for Architect**:
1. What's the optimal tree depth for complex distributed systems like ELIAS?
2. Should IDs be hierarchical (1.2.3.4) or hash-based for better change tolerance?
3. How do we handle cross-component dependencies in the tree structure?
4. What metadata should each spec node contain (performance expectations, dependencies, etc.)?

### 2. Intelligent Testing System
**Problem**: When components fail, we need systematic isolation to find root causes efficiently.

**Proposed Solution**: Tree-traversal testing where:
- When leaf X fails, test all subordinate leaves individually
- Model creates mocks/direct implementations for each leaf
- If mock works but real component fails → identified culprit
- Recursive descent: go deeper into failing component's sub-tree
- Continue until atomic-level failure is isolated

**Questions for Architect**:
1. How do we prevent exponential test explosion in large component trees?
2. What's the optimal mock generation strategy (static vs dynamic vs model-generated)?
3. Should we cache successful leaf tests to avoid redundant testing?
4. How do we handle timing-dependent failures that may not reproduce in isolated testing?

### 3. Proactive Debugging System  
**Problem**: Same as testing but for known errors - need systematic approach to isolate issues.

**Proposed Solution**: Identical to testing system but triggered by known failure states rather than comprehensive validation.

**Questions for Architect**:
1. How do we differentiate between "testing" (discovering new errors) vs "debugging" (isolating known errors) in practice?
2. Should debugging use different traversal strategies (depth-first vs breadth-first) than testing?
3. How do we maintain debugging history to learn from past failure patterns?

### 4. Integration Validation System ("Pseudo-Compiler")
**Problem**: Before adding new components to distributed ELIAS architecture, need comprehensive validation without testing every existing component.

**Proposed Solution**: Dependency-aware validation system where:
- New component passes full tree testing (all leaves validated)
- System analyzes dependency graph to identify affected existing components
- Only test components that could be impacted by new addition
- Full system integration test on subset of critical paths

**Questions for Architect**:
1. **Naming**: What's better than "pseudo-compiler"? Options: Integration Validator, Component Certifier, System Harmonizer, Dependency Analyzer?
2. **Dependency Analysis**: How do we build accurate dependency graphs for distributed Erlang/OTP systems?
3. **Impact Scope**: What algorithms determine "impact radius" of new components?
4. **Performance**: How do we balance thoroughness vs speed for large systems (1000+ components)?
5. **Rollback**: How do we safely undo integrations that pass initial validation but cause runtime issues?

## Technical Implementation Questions

### Tiki File Format & Structure
```
elias_mail.tiki:
├── 1.0 send_functionality
│   ├── 1.1 authentication  
│   ├── 1.2 message_composition
│   └── 1.3 delivery_routing
├── 2.0 receive_functionality  
│   ├── 2.1 inbox_monitoring
│   └── 2.2 message_parsing
└── 3.0 storage_management
    ├── 3.1 file_operations
    └── 3.2 cleanup_routines
```

**Questions**:
1. Should we use YAML, JSON, custom DSL, or other format for .tiki files?
2. How do we version tiki specifications alongside code changes?
3. What's the relationship between .tiki (specs), .md (AI rules), and .ex (code) files?
4. How do we ensure tiki specs stay synchronized with actual code implementations?

### Model Integration & Automation
**Current Context**: Claude and other models need to interact with this system for:
- Generating mocks for failed components
- Creating direct implementations for testing
- Analyzing dependency graphs
- Making integration decisions

**Questions**:
1. Should models have direct access to .tiki files or work through API layers?
2. How do we prevent models from making dangerous changes during testing/debugging?
3. What's the security model for AI-generated mocks in production systems?
4. How do we validate that model-generated implementations actually match tiki specifications?

### Distributed System Considerations
**ELIAS Context**: Multi-node Erlang/OTP system with:
- UFM (Federation Manager) coordinating across nodes
- Manager-to-manager communication via UCM  
- Hot-reloading capabilities for live systems
- Blockchain integration (APE HARMONY) for event logging

**Questions**:
1. How do tiki specifications handle distributed component interactions?
2. Should testing/debugging run on single nodes or across federation?
3. How do we test components that require multi-node coordination?
4. What's the relationship between tiki system and existing OTP supervision trees?

### Performance & Scalability Architecture
**Challenge**: System must handle:
- Large codebases (1000+ components)
- Real-time debugging during production issues  
- Continuous integration of new components
- Distributed testing across multiple nodes

**Questions**:
1. What's the optimal caching strategy for tiki specifications and test results?
2. How do we parallelize testing/debugging across available system resources?
3. Should the tiki system be itself distributed or centralized?
4. What are the memory/CPU requirements for large-scale tiki operations?

## Integration with Existing ELIAS Architecture

### Current State
- 6 Manager architecture (UFM, UCM, UAM, UIM, URM, ULM) 
- Supervised process trees with fault isolation
- Hot-reloadable .md rule files
- APE HARMONY blockchain for event logging
- Python ML integration via Ports

### Integration Points
1. **Manager Specifications**: Each manager needs full tiki specification tree
2. **Cross-Manager Dependencies**: How do we spec interactions between managers?  
3. **Hot-Reload Integration**: Tiki changes should trigger appropriate system updates
4. **Blockchain Logging**: Integration events should be logged to APE HARMONY
5. **ML Integration**: How do Python components fit into tiki specification system?

## Success Criteria for Tiki System

### Technical Requirements
- Specs automatically stay synchronized with code

## Questions for Architect Decision

1. **Architecture Pattern**: Should tiki system be centralized service or distributed across nodes?
2. **Implementation Priority**: Which of the 4 pillars should we implement first for maximum impact?
3. **Integration Strategy**: How do we migrate existing ELIAS components to tiki system gradually?
4. **Tooling Ecosystem**: What development tools (IDE plugins, CLI tools, etc.) are needed?
5. **Standards & Conventions**: What coding standards ensure tiki specs remain maintainable?

This tiki system represents a fundamental shift toward formal specification-driven development with automated validation. We need architectural guidance to implement this vision effectively while maintaining ELIAS's distributed, always-on philosophy.
