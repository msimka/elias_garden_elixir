# Memory Calculation Clarification - DeepSeek 6.7B FP16

## üîç **Breaking Down The Numbers**

### **Model Parameter Count vs Memory Usage**

#### **DeepSeek 6.7B Model:**
- **Parameters**: 6.7 billion parameters
- **FP16 Format**: 2 bytes per parameter  
- **Model Weights**: 6.7B √ó 2 bytes = **13.4GB**

#### **Inference Memory (VRAM/RAM)**
- **Model Weights**: 13.4GB
- **KV Cache**: ~1-3GB (depends on context length)
- **Activations**: ~1-2GB (temporary computation)
- **Framework Overhead**: ~0.5-1GB
- **Total Inference**: **~16-19GB VRAM**

#### **Training Memory (Much Higher)**
Training requires additional components:
- **Model Weights**: 13.4GB
- **Gradients**: 13.4GB (same size as weights)
- **Optimizer States**: 26.8GB (AdamW stores momentum + variance = 2x weights)
- **Activations for Backprop**: 5-10GB (depends on batch size)
- **Total Training**: **~58-63GB VRAM**

## ü§î **The Architect's "50GB" Statement**

The architect said: *"~50GB per model for AdamW optimizer (params + grads + states)"*

**This is referring to TRAINING memory, not inference!**

### **Breakdown of 50GB Training Memory:**
- Model weights: 13.4GB
- Gradients: 13.4GB  
- AdamW optimizer states: 26.8GB (2x weights)
- Training overhead: ~5GB
- **Total**: ~58GB ‚âà "50GB" (architect's approximation)

## üìä **Corrected Memory Requirements**

### **For Inference (What We Need on Griffith)**
```
Single Model: 16-19GB VRAM
7 Models Total: 112-133GB VRAM
Griffith Planning: 128GB+ RAM needed for all models
```

### **For Training (Cloud Only)**
```
Single Model Training: 50-60GB VRAM  
Our Cloud Setup:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Kaggle P100: 16GB VRAM (INSUFFICIENT for full training)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SageMaker V100: 16GB VRAM (INSUFFICIENT for full training)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Need: Multi-GPU instances or gradient checkpointing
```

## üö® **Critical Realization: Our Cloud Setup Won't Work**

### **The Problem**
- **Required for Training**: 50-60GB VRAM per model
- **Available on Kaggle P100**: 16GB VRAM
- **Available on SageMaker V100**: 16GB VRAM

**We cannot train full DeepSeek 6.7B models on our current cloud setup!**

### **Solutions Needed**

#### **Option 1: Multi-GPU Cloud Instances**
- **SageMaker**: Use multi-GPU instances (4x V100 = 64GB VRAM)
- **Cost Impact**: Significantly higher than single GPU
- **Kaggle**: Limited multi-GPU options in free tier

#### **Option 2: Gradient Checkpointing**
- **Memory Reduction**: Trade compute for memory (slower but fits in 16GB)
- **Implementation**: PyTorch/HuggingFace supports this
- **Trade-off**: 20-30% slower training

#### **Option 3: LoRA Training Only**
- **Memory Requirements**: Much lower (~20-30GB for LoRA)
- **Quality**: Nearly as good as full fine-tuning
- **Fits Current Setup**: Works on single V100/P100

## üéØ **Updated Questions for Architect**

1. **Training Strategy**: Given our 16GB cloud GPUs, should we:
   - Use gradient checkpointing to fit full training?
   - Switch to LoRA-only training approach?
   - Upgrade to multi-GPU cloud instances?

2. **Memory Calculations**: Can you confirm the exact VRAM requirements for:
   - DeepSeek 6.7B FP16 inference
   - DeepSeek 6.7B FP16 training with different batch sizes
   - LoRA adapter training memory requirements

3. **Federation Planning**: With corrected 16-19GB per model:
   - Should minimum full nodes be 24GB RAM (safe margin)?
   - How many models can realistically run on 32GB, 64GB nodes?
   - Is our 128GB Griffith planning adequate?

The architect mixed up **training memory (50GB)** with **inference memory (16-19GB)** in their explanation. We need clarification on both!
