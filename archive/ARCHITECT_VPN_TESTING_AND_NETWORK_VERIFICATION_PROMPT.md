# Architect Consultation: VPN Testing & Network Verification for Remote Access Solutions

## üéØ **Critical Task: Verify External Network Access Solutions**

### **Context & Current Status**
I have successfully implemented **SSH access to Griffith** from external networks using a bore tunnel:
- ‚úÖ **SSH Working**: `ssh -p 1628 msimka@bore.pub` 
- ‚úÖ **Tunnel Active**: bore.pub:1628 ‚Üí Griffith:22
- ‚úÖ **Configuration Complete**: SSH config added for `ssh griffith-remote`

However, **NoMachine remote desktop was previously configured** (last week) and reportedly works from:
- ‚úÖ **MacBook** (current network)
- ‚úÖ **Phone** (external network/cellular) 
- ‚úÖ **Multiple networks** confirmed by user

**Problem**: I cannot verify the NoMachine external access mechanism without testing from a different network. User has requested I "test it with a VPN" and "can't just quit" - requiring a complete verification solution.

## üîç **Investigation Needed**

### **NoMachine Configuration Discovery**
I found evidence of NoMachine setup but unclear external access method:

**Current State on Griffith:**
```bash
# Service Status
‚óã nxserver.service - active (running)
tcp 0.0.0.0:4000 - LISTEN (confirmed)

# Public IP Test Failed
nc -v 98.153.148.131 4000 ‚Üí Connection refused

# Server Config Indicates Cloud Features
grep -i cloud /usr/NX/etc/server.cfg ‚Üí Multiple cloud server references
```

**Possible External Access Methods:**
1. **NoMachine Cloud Relay**: Built-in tunnel through NoMachine servers
2. **Port Forwarding**: Office router configuration (user has no access)
3. **VPN/Tunnel**: Another tunneling solution running
4. **UPnP/NAT-PMP**: Automatic port mapping
5. **Different Service**: Not actually NoMachine but another remote desktop

## üöÄ **Required Solutions from Architect**

### **Priority 1: VPN Testing Capability (IMMEDIATE)**
I need step-by-step instructions for setting up **command-line VPN access** on macOS to test external network connectivity:

**Requirements:**
- **Free/trial VPN service** that works via CLI
- **No GUI required** - must work through terminal
- **Quick setup** (under 5 minutes)
- **Reliable for testing** network access changes

**Specific Guidance Needed:**
```bash
# What commands should I run?
brew install <what>
<service> signup/login <how>
<service> connect <location>
curl ifconfig.me  # Should show different IP
# Test NoMachine and SSH from new IP
<service> disconnect
```

### **Priority 2: NoMachine External Access Analysis**
**Systematic investigation approach** to determine how NoMachine external access was configured:

**Configuration Discovery:**
1. **NoMachine Cloud Service**: How to verify if cloud relay is enabled?
2. **Connection Logs**: Where to find external connection attempts?
3. **Network Configuration**: What files contain external access settings?
4. **Service Dependencies**: Are there other services enabling external access?

**Verification Commands:**
```bash
# What should I run on Griffith to determine external access method?
sudo <command-to-check-cloud-config>
sudo <command-to-check-upnp-status> 
sudo <command-to-check-active-tunnels>
<command-to-test-external-connectivity>
```

### **Priority 3: Complete Network Testing Protocol**
**Step-by-step testing procedure** once VPN is available:

**Testing Sequence:**
1. **Baseline Test**: Verify current network connectivity
2. **VPN Connection**: Connect to external network
3. **SSH Verification**: Test bore tunnel still works
4. **NoMachine Discovery**: Determine and test NoMachine access method
5. **Documentation**: Record working connection methods
6. **Fallback Setup**: Ensure redundant access methods

### **Priority 4: Troubleshooting & Fallback Plans**
**What to do when things don't work:**

**If VPN Setup Fails:**
- Alternative VPN services to try
- Proxy-based testing methods
- Mobile hotspot testing approach

**If NoMachine Isn't Externally Accessible:**
- How to set up NoMachine cloud relay
- Alternative remote desktop solutions (VNC, RDP via tunnels)
- How to create bore tunnel for NoMachine (port 4000)

**If Network Access Breaks:**
- Recovery procedures for SSH access
- How to restart/reconfigure bore tunnel
- Backup connection methods

## üîß **Technical Environment Details**

### **Current Network Setup**
- **Office Network**: 172.20.35.0/22 (shared workspace)
- **MacBook IP**: 172.20.35.25
- **Griffith IP**: 172.20.35.144  
- **Public IP**: 98.153.148.131 (Charter Communications)
- **No Router Access**: Cannot configure port forwarding

### **Installed Software**
**MacBook:**
- NoMachine.app (installed, running processes visible)
- cloudflared, bore, netbird (installed)
- SSH config already configured for griffith-remote

**Griffith (Linux):**
- NoMachine server (nxserver.service active)
- bore tunnel active (port 22 ‚Üí bore.pub:1628)
- cloudflared, localtunnel installed

### **Working Solutions Currently**
- ‚úÖ **SSH**: `ssh -p 1628 msimka@bore.pub` (verified working)
- ‚ùì **NoMachine**: Claims to work externally but method unknown
- ‚úÖ **Local Access**: Both SSH and NoMachine work on local network

## üéØ **Specific Questions for Architect**

### **1. VPN Solution for Testing**
**What's the fastest way to set up VPN testing on macOS via CLI?**
- Recommended free VPN service with CLI support?
- Complete setup commands for immediate use?
- How to verify IP change and test connectivity?

### **2. NoMachine External Access Investigation**
**How should I systematically determine NoMachine's external access method?**
- Key configuration files to examine?
- Commands to reveal cloud/relay configuration?
- How to identify if UPnP/NAT-PMP is working?

### **3. Testing Protocol**
**What's the complete testing sequence once VPN is available?**
- Order of operations for network testing?
- What to test first, second, third?
- How to document findings for user?

### **4. Backup Solutions**
**If NoMachine external access isn't working, what should I implement?**
- How to set up bore tunnel for NoMachine port 4000?
- Alternative remote desktop solutions through existing SSH tunnel?
- Recovery procedures if testing breaks existing access?

### **5. Federation Networking Integration**
**How does this testing relate to the broader ELIAS federation networking?**
- Should I implement NetBird alongside existing solutions?
- How to integrate bore tunnels with federation architecture?
- Planning for multiple users needing external access?

## ‚ö° **Immediate Action Required**

**User expectation**: Complete verification of external access solutions with proper VPN testing.

**Cannot proceed without**:
1. **VPN setup instructions** for immediate testing
2. **NoMachine investigation commands** to determine external access method  
3. **Systematic testing protocol** to verify all solutions work from external networks

**Success criteria**: 
- Demonstrate both SSH and NoMachine working from VPN-simulated external network
- Document exact connection methods for future use
- Ensure redundant access methods for reliable remote work

---

**Architect**: I need complete, step-by-step instructions to:
1. **Set up VPN testing capability immediately** (specific commands, service recommendations)
2. **Systematically investigate NoMachine external access** (exact commands to run)
3. **Execute comprehensive network testing** from simulated external network
4. **Implement backup solutions** if current NoMachine setup isn't working as claimed

**Priority**: This is blocking verification of critical remote access infrastructure needed for daily development work. User requires immediate, actionable guidance that can be executed via terminal without GUI interactions.
