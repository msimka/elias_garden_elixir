# Architect Guidance Request: Tiki Language Manager Architecture Decision

## Context: System-Wide Tiki Integration Requirements

The Tiki Language Methodology has evolved into a comprehensive system that affects every aspect of ELIAS development, testing, and integration. We need architectural guidance on whether this warrants a dedicated manager within the 6-manager architecture, and how to integrate it without violating the established design principles.

## Current Tiki System Scope

### Comprehensive Functionality
The Tiki system now encompasses:

1. **Specification Management**
   - Hierarchical .tiki file parsing and validation
   - Code-to-spec synchronization verification
   - Cross-component dependency analysis
   - Hot-reload of specifications across distributed nodes

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Tree-traversal testing with mock generation
   - Hierarchical failure isolation (breadth-first → depth-first)
   - Cache-optimized test execution with ETS storage
   - Distributed testing coordination across federation

3. **Debugging Engine**
   - Known failure isolation using tree traversal
   - AI-generated mock implementations for component testing
   - Historical failure pattern analysis and learning
   - Real-time debugging session management

4. **System Harmonizer (Integration Validation)**
   - Dependency graph analysis with impact radius calculation
   - Pre-integration testing of new components
   - Performance regression detection and approval thresholds
   - Rollback capabilities for failed integrations

5. **Development Tooling**
   - Mix CLI tasks (tiki.validate, tiki.test, tiki.debug, tiki.harmonize)
   - IDE integration capabilities
   - Developer workflow automation
   - Continuous integration pipeline integration

### Cross-Manager Integration Points
The Tiki system interacts with ALL existing managers:

- **UFM**: Federation testing, distributed spec validation, node capability verification
- **UCM**: Communication pattern testing, message routing validation
- **UAM**: Creative workflow testing, ML integration validation
- **UIM**: Interface specification validation, hardware integration testing
- **URM**: Resource allocation testing, dependency management validation
- **ULM**: Learning system testing, model training validation

## Architectural Decision Questions

### 1. Manager vs Service Decision
**Question**: Should Tiki be a 7th manager (UTM - Universal Tiki Manager) or remain as a service/library used by other managers?

**Considerations**:
- **Pro-Manager**: Tiki has substantial independent functionality, always-on requirements, distributed coordination needs
- **Pro-Service**: Tiki is more of a "meta-system" that supports other managers rather than providing end-user functionality
- **Complexity**: Adding 7th manager violates the carefully designed 6-manager architecture
- **Integration**: Tiki needs deep integration with ALL managers' internal operations

### 2. Always-On Requirements Analysis
**Question**: Does Tiki system require always-on daemon behavior matching ELIAS philosophy?

**Tiki Always-On Behaviors**:
- Continuous specification synchronization monitoring
- Real-time dependency graph updates
- Background test execution and regression detection
- Active debugging session management
- Hot-reload coordination across distributed nodes
- Integration validation queue processing

**Analysis**: These behaviors strongly suggest manager-level requirements rather than on-demand service usage.

### 3. Distributed Coordination Needs
**Question**: How should Tiki coordinate across the Gracey/Griffith federation?

**Coordination Requirements**:
- Specification synchronization across nodes
- Distributed test execution coordination
- Cross-node dependency analysis
- Federation-wide integration validation
- Shared caching and state management

**Architecture Options**:
- **Option A**: UTM manager with sub-daemons (following UFM pattern)
- **Option B**: Tiki service integrated into UFM federation coordination
- **Option C**: Distributed Tiki engine with UCM communication coordination

### 4. Integration with Existing Architecture
**Question**: How does Tiki integration affect the established manager relationships and supervision trees?

**Current Manager Interactions**:
```
UFM ←→ UCM ←→ UAM
 ↕     ↕     ↕
URM ←→ ULM ←→ UIM
```

**With Tiki Integration**:
```
Option A: UTM as 7th manager affecting all relationships
Option B: Tiki as UFM sub-daemon affecting federation
Option C: Tiki as UCM service affecting communication
```

### 5. Resource and Performance Implications
**Question**: What are the resource requirements and performance implications of different Tiki architectures?

**Resource Analysis**:
- **Memory**: Specification caching, dependency graphs, test results
- **CPU**: Continuous validation, tree traversal testing, mock generation
- **Network**: Distributed coordination, spec synchronization, test coordination
- **Storage**: Test history, spec versions, debugging sessions

**Performance Requirements**:
- Specification validation: <100ms per spec
- Tree testing: <5 minutes for full component validation
- Integration analysis: <10 minutes for impact assessment
- Real-time debugging: <30 seconds for failure isolation

## Specific Architectural Guidance Needed

### 1. Manager Architecture Decision
**Primary Question**: Should we implement UTM (Universal Tiki Manager) as the 7th manager, or integrate Tiki functionality into existing managers?

**Sub-questions**:
- If UTM: How does it fit into the 6-manager interaction patterns?
- If integrated: Which manager should own primary Tiki coordination (UFM, UCM, or distributed)?
- How do we maintain the elegant 6-manager symmetry while adding system-wide Tiki capabilities?

### 2. Supervision and Fault Tolerance
**Question**: How should Tiki system handle failures and restarts within ELIAS architecture?

**Considerations**:
- Tiki system failure could affect ALL managers' development and testing
- Spec synchronization failures could cause distributed inconsistencies  
- Test system failures could block integration of new components
- Debugging system failures could hinder production issue resolution

### 3. Hot-Reload and Configuration Management
**Question**: How should Tiki specifications coordinate with existing .md rule files and hot-reload mechanisms?

**Current State**:
- Each manager has .md files for AI interaction rules
- UFM coordinates rule reloading across federation
- Hot-reload is critical for always-on system maintenance

**Tiki Integration**:
- .tiki files need similar hot-reload capabilities
- Coordination with .md file reloading
- Distributed specification synchronization
- Version conflict resolution

### 4. Development Workflow Integration
**Question**: How should Tiki CLI tools integrate with existing ELIAS development workflows?

**Current Development Process**:
1. Code changes in manager .ex files
2. Rule updates in .md files  
3. Testing via existing scripts
4. Deployment via UFM coordination

**Tiki-Enhanced Process**:
1. Code changes with .tiki spec updates
2. Automated validation via mix tiki.validate
3. Integration testing via mix tiki.harmonize
4. Deployment with Tiki approval gates

### 5. Data Architecture and Persistence
**Question**: How should Tiki system manage its data architecture within ELIAS distributed environment?

**Data Requirements**:
- Specification storage and versioning
- Test result history and analytics
- Dependency graph persistence
- Debugging session state
- Integration approval audit trails

**Storage Options**:
- ETS for in-memory caching (current approach)
- APE HARMONY blockchain for audit trails
- Local file system for specifications
- Distributed database for shared state

## Success Criteria for Architectural Decision

### System Integration
- Preserves elegant 6-manager architecture principles
- Maintains existing manager interaction patterns  
- Supports future manager additions without breaking Tiki
- Enables gradual adoption without system-wide changes

## Recommendation Request

Please provide definitive guidance on:

1. **Architecture Pattern**: UTM as 7th manager vs. distributed integration
2. **Primary Ownership**: Which existing manager should coordinate Tiki if not UTM
3. **Implementation Priority**: Phases for Tiki integration without disrupting current system
4. **Data Architecture**: Optimal storage and caching strategies for Tiki data
5. **Federation Strategy**: How Tiki coordinates across distributed ELIAS nodes

This decision affects the fundamental architecture of ELIAS and will determine how we implement formal specification-driven development across the entire system. We need architectural wisdom to ensure we enhance ELIAS without breaking its elegant distributed design.
