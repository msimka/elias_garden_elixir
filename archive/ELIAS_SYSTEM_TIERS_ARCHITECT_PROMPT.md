# ELIAS Federation System Tiers - Hardware Specification & Deployment Architecture

## System Tier Classification

Based on our UFF training implementation and ELIAS federation requirements, we're establishing three distinct deployment tiers for the ecosystem. We need your architectural guidance on hardware specifications and blockchain integration requirements for each tier.

## Proposed Three-Tier Architecture

### **Tier 1: Apemacs Client-Only Nodes**
**Target Users**: End users, lightweight interactions, content consumption
**Current Understanding**: 
- Apemacs client interface only
- No local inference or training
- Minimal hardware requirements

**Hardware Questions:**
- Can this truly run on Raspberry Pi 4/5 as intended?
- What are the minimum RAM requirements for Apemacs client?
- CPU requirements (ARM vs x86, core count)?
- Storage requirements for client software and local caching?
- Network bandwidth requirements for federation communication?

### **Tier 2: ELIAS Server - Inference Only**
**Target Users**: Small businesses, developers, inference service providers
**Current Understanding**:
- Runs UFF model inference for component generation
- Handles UFM federation participation
- No local model training capability

**Hardware Questions:**
- You mentioned "at least 8GB VRAM GPU" - what specific GPU models are viable?
- CPU requirements (core count, architecture preferences)?
- RAM requirements for inference workloads?
- Storage requirements for model weights and inference cache?
- Network requirements for UFM federation participation?
- Can this tier run URM (UFM Resource Manager) effectively?

### **Tier 3: ELIAS Server - Training + Inference** 
**Target Users**: AI researchers, model developers, federation infrastructure providers
**Current Implementation**: 
- This is my current build target (upgrading to dual RTX 5060 Ti = 32GB VRAM)
- Full UFF training capability as per your architecture
- Complete UFM federation server capabilities

**Hardware Validation Questions:**
- Is dual RTX 5060 Ti (32GB total VRAM) the minimum viable for this tier?
- What about higher-tier configurations (RTX 4090, A6000, H100)?
- CPU requirements beyond Ryzen 9950X (core count, memory channels)?
- RAM requirements beyond 128GB for training workloads?
- Storage requirements (NVMe speed, capacity for datasets/checkpoints)?
- Network requirements for distributed training coordination?

## Blockchain Integration: Ape Harmony Node Requirements

**Critical Gap in Our Architecture**: We have the UFF training system designed, but need clarity on Ape Harmony blockchain integration for each tier.

### **Blockchain Participation Questions:**

**1. Full Node Requirements**
- Which tiers should run full Ape Harmony blockchain nodes?
- Hardware specifications for full node operation (CPU, RAM, storage)?
- Bandwidth requirements for blockchain synchronization?
- Integration with ELIAS federation services?

**2. Wallet Node Requirements**
- Which tiers need local wallet capabilities vs. remote wallet access?
- Hardware requirements for secure key management?
- HSM (Hardware Security Module) recommendations for Tier 3?
- Integration with component generation and verification workflows?

**3. Mining/Validation Participation**
- Should Tier 3 nodes participate in blockchain consensus?
- Hardware requirements for mining/validation (if applicable)?
- How does training workload affect blockchain participation?
- Economic incentives for running full blockchain nodes?

**4. Blockchain Storage Requirements**
- Current Ape Harmony blockchain size and growth projections?
- Storage requirements for full nodes vs. light nodes?
- Pruning strategies for different tiers?

## UFM Federation Architecture Questions

### **Federation Participation by Tier**

**1. UFM Service Roles**
- Which UFM services can each tier provide?
- Can Tier 2 participate in UFM without training capabilities?
- How do Tier 1 nodes discover and connect to UFM services?

**2. Load Distribution**
- How should inference requests be distributed across Tier 2/3 nodes?
- Failover strategies when Tier 3 nodes are training?
- Geographic distribution considerations for UFM nodes?

**3. Economic Model**
- Token economics for different tier participation?
- How are Tier 2/3 operators compensated for providing services?
- Cost structure for Tier 1 users accessing services?

## Deployment and Operations Questions

### **1. Software Distribution**
- How is ELIAS software packaged and distributed to different tiers?
- Update mechanisms for each tier (especially during training)?
- Configuration management across heterogeneous hardware?

### **2. Monitoring and Management**
- Centralized monitoring for multi-tier deployments?
- How does URM manage resources across different tier capabilities?
- Health checks and failover procedures?

### **3. Security Considerations**
- Security requirements different across tiers?
- VPN/secure networking requirements for federation participation?
- Key management and rotation procedures?

## Specific Hardware Recommendations Needed

Please provide specific hardware recommendations for:

**Tier 1 (Apemacs Client)**:
- Minimum viable hardware specifications
- Recommended hardware specifications  
- Supported architectures (ARM, x86, other)

**Tier 2 (Inference Server)**:
- Entry-level configuration
- Recommended configuration
- High-performance configuration

**Tier 3 (Training + Inference)**:
- Minimum viable configuration (is my dual RTX 5060 Ti adequate?)
- Recommended professional configuration
- High-end research/enterprise configuration

**Blockchain Infrastructure**:
- Full node hardware requirements
- Wallet node security requirements
- Mining/validation participation specs

## Timeline and Implementation Priority

We're ready to purchase the second RTX 5060 Ti and complete our Tier 3 implementation. We need your guidance to:

1. Validate our Tier 3 hardware approach
2. Plan Tier 2 reference implementations
3. Design Tier 1 deployment strategy
4. Integrate Ape Harmony blockchain requirements across all tiers

Please provide comprehensive hardware specifications, deployment architectures, and blockchain integration guidance for the three-tier ELIAS federation ecosystem.
