## 🎨 Creative Content Generation

### Writing Assistant

**Business Writing**
```
Input: "Draft a proposal for increasing our marketing budget"

ELIAS Response (personalized to your style):
"Based on your preference for data-driven narratives, here's a compelling proposal:

Executive Summary:
Our Q3 marketing ROI of 312% demonstrates clear opportunity for scaled investment. 
I recommend increasing our budget by 40% to capture the momentum we've built..."

[Continues with your specific tone, structure preferences, and persuasion style]
```

**Creative Writing**
```
Input: "Help me write a short story about AI and humanity"

ELIAS: "I know you love philosophical themes with unexpected endings. Here's a story 
that matches your narrative style:

'The Last Question She Asked'

Maya had interviewed a thousand AIs, but this one was different. Not because 
of its responses, but because of its questions..."

[Story continues in your preferred genre, pacing, and thematic style]
```

### Code Generation

**Personalized Programming Style**
```
Input: "Create a React component for user authentication"

ELIAS Response (learns your coding preferences):
```javascript
// Generated in your preferred style: functional components, TypeScript, comprehensive error handling

import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';
import { AuthService } from '../services/auth.service';

interface AuthProps {
  onSuccess: (user: User) => void;
  onError: (error: AuthError) => void;
}

const AuthComponent: React.FC<AuthProps> = ({ onSuccess, onError }) => {
  // Your preferred state management pattern
  const [credentials, setCredentials] = useState({
    email: '',
    password: ''
  });

  // Your preferred error handling approach
  const handleAuth = useCallback(async () => {
    try {
      const user = await AuthService.authenticate(credentials);
      onSuccess(user);
    } catch (error) {
      onError(error as AuthError);
    }
  }, [credentials, onSuccess, onError]);

  // Continues with your preferred component structure...
};
```

## 🧠 Understanding Your LoRA Forest

### What are Micro-LoRAs?

Think of micro-LoRAs as tiny specialists in your brain extension. Each one learns a specific aspect of how you think and work:

- **Creative Writing LoRA**: Learns your narrative voice, vocabulary choices, story structures
- **Business Communication LoRA**: Adapts to your professional tone, presentation style  
- **Code Style LoRA**: Masters your programming patterns, naming conventions, architecture preferences
- **Problem Solving LoRA**: Understands how you break down complex problems

- Offline mode: Full functionality without internet
- Conflict resolution: Smart merging of improvements from different devices

**Federation Nodes**:
- Rent additional compute power for intensive tasks
- Your data never leaves nodes you control
- Share costs with friends/colleagues for group nodes

### Team Collaboration

**Enterprise Features**:
- Share domain-specific LoRAs with team members
- Collaborative LoRA training on team communication patterns  
- Maintain individual personalization within team standards

**Privacy Controls**:
```
Sharing Levels:
├── None: Keep everything private

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"ELIAS is responding slowly"**
- Check your device memory (ELIAS needs 100MB minimum)
- Reduce active LoRA count if over 2000
- Switch to Fast Mode for better performance
- Clear ELIAS cache in Settings

**"Responses don't match my style"**
- Provide more feedback with 👍/👎 on responses
- Upload recent examples of your writing/code
- Check that the right domain LoRAs are active
- Manual training may be needed for new domains

**"Can't sync across devices"**
- Verify internet connection
- Check federation node status in Settings  
- Force sync in Settings → Sync Now
- Contact support if sync fails repeatedly

trainer = elias_sdk.LoRATrainer(
    user_id="your_user_id",
    domain="custom_domain",
    specialization="technical_writing"
)

# Add your training data
trainer.add_samples(your_training_data)
trainer.add_feedback(positive_examples, negative_examples)

# Train and deploy
new_lora = trainer.train()
elias_sdk.deploy_lora(new_lora)
```
