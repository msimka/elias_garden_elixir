# ELIAS Federation Nodes - User Manual

## Understanding the ELIAS Federation Network

The ELIAS Federation is a distributed network of compute nodes that work together to provide scalable, high-availability AI services while keeping your data secure and private. Think of it as a cooperative network where nodes share resources to provide better service for everyone.

---

## 🌐 What is Federation?

### For Individual Users

**Personal Federation Benefits**:
- **High Availability**: Your AI never goes offline - if one node fails, others take over
- **Global Access**: Access your personalized AI from anywhere in the world
- **Scalable Resources**: Automatically get more compute power when you need it
- **Data Sovereignty**: You control which nodes can access your data

**How it Works for You**:
```
Your Device → Regional Federation Node → Your Personalized LoRA Forest
     ↓                    ↓                         ↓
Mobile App        Distributed Compute        AI Training & Inference
```

### For Organizations

**Enterprise Federation Benefits**:
- **Dedicated Resources**: Private compute pools for your team
- **Compliance Controls**: Meet SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA requirements
- **Team Collaboration**: Share AI improvements across your organization
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay only for what you use, scale automatically

## 📱 Connecting Your Devices to Federation

### Automatic Device Registration

When you first install ELIAS, your device automatically registers with the federation:

1. **Device Verification**
   ```
   ✅ Device identity verified via secure chip (TPM/Secure Enclave)
   ✅ Region detected: US West (optimal latency: 15ms)
   ✅ Assigned to federation node: fed-us-west-2-primary
   ✅ Security certificates generated
   ```

2. **Capability Assessment**
   ```
   Device Capabilities Detected:
   ├── CPU: 8 cores, 3.2GHz
   ├── Memory: 16GB available for ELIAS
   ├── GPU: Available (Metal/CUDA support)
   ├── Storage: 512GB SSD (fast LoRA loading)
   └── Network: 1Gbps broadband
   
   Recommended Settings:
   ├── Max LoRAs: 1600 (based on memory)
   ├── Inference Quota: 10,000/hour

## 🔄 Understanding LoRA Forest Synchronization

### What Gets Synchronized

Your LoRA forest synchronizes across federation nodes to ensure availability:

**Synchronized Data**:
- ✅ LoRA adaptation weights and architectures
- ✅ Training progress and effectiveness metrics  
- ✅ User preferences and personalization settings
- ✅ Performance optimization data

**Never Synchronized**:
- ❌ Your raw input data (voice recordings, documents)
- ❌ Private keys and authentication credentials
- ❌ Device-specific performance metrics
- ❌ Personal files and documents

### Monitoring Your Sync Status

**Real-Time Sync Dashboard**:
```
Forest Sync Status: ✅ Healthy
├── Last Sync: 2 minutes ago
├── Nodes in Sync: 3/3 federation nodes
├── Pending Updates: 12 LoRA improvements
├── Conflicts: 0 (auto-resolved)
└── Next Sync: 3 minutes

Sync Performance:
├── Average Sync Time: 1.2 seconds
├── Data Transferred: 2.4MB (compressed)
├── Conflicts Resolved: 847 (lifetime)
└── Sync Success Rate: 99.97%
```

**Handling Sync Conflicts**:

When your device has been offline and LoRAs have improved on both your device and federation nodes:

```
Sync Conflict Detected: Creative Writing LoRA v2.1
├── Your Version: Improved at 10:30 AM (offline training)
├── Federation Version: Improved at 10:35 AM (cloud training) 
├── Resolution Strategy: Merge both improvements
└── Result: Combined version is 12% more effective

Automatic Resolution Applied ✅
```

---

## 🤝 Node Cooperation & Consensus

### How Nodes Make Decisions Together

Federation nodes work together to make decisions about:
- Resource allocation and scaling
- Network optimizations and updates
- Security policies and compliance
- Performance improvements

**Democratic Decision Making**:
```
Proposal: "Increase inference cache size by 50%"
├── Node Voting:
│   ├── US-West Nodes: 12 Approve, 1 Abstain
│   ├── US-East Nodes: 8 Approve, 2 Abstain  
│   ├── EU Nodes: 15 Approve, 0 Reject
│   └── Total: 35 Approve (78% stake weight)
├── Consensus: ✅ APPROVED (requires 67%)
└── Implementation: Scheduled for tonight 2 AM UTC
```

**What This Means for You**:
- Network improvements happen automatically
- Your service quality continuously improves
- No single node can make unilateral changes
- Transparency in all network decisions

### Participating in Federation Governance

**For Individual Users**:
- Vote on privacy policy changes
- Suggest network improvements
- Report issues and bugs
- Provide feedback on new features

**For Node Operators**:
- Propose technical improvements
- Vote on network policies
- Participate in consensus decisions
- Earn reputation through good service

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Federation Issues

### Common Connection Problems

**"Can't connect to federation node"**

*Symptoms*: ELIAS shows "Connecting..." for more than 30 seconds

*Solutions*:
1. **Check Internet Connection**
   ```bash
   # Test federation connectivity
   ping fed-us-west-2.elias.brain
   curl https://fed-us-west-2.elias.brain/health
   ```

2. **Clear ELIAS Cache**
   ```
   Desktop: Settings → Advanced → Clear Federation Cache
   Mobile: Settings → Storage → Clear ELIAS Data
   ```

3. **Reset Device Registration**
   ```bash
   elias-cli federation reset-registration
   # Follow prompts to re-register device
   ```

**"Sync is taking too long"**

*Symptoms*: LoRA forest sync stuck at "Synchronizing..." for 10+ minutes

*Solutions*:
1. **Check Forest Size**
   ```
   Large forests (>2000 LoRAs) take longer to sync
   Consider archiving unused LoRAs:
   Settings → My LoRA Forest → Archive Unused
   ```

2. **Verify Network Quality**
   ```
   Required: >5 Mbps upload speed
   Current: Check at Settings → Diagnostics → Network Test
   ```

3. **Force Incremental Sync**
   ```bash
   elias-cli sync force-incremental
   # Syncs only changes instead of full forest
   ```

### Performance Optimization

**"ELIAS responses are slower than usual"**

*Check Federation Load*:
```
Current Node Status:
├── fed-us-west-2-primary: 89% load (HIGH)
├── fed-us-west-2-backup: 34% load (NORMAL)  
├── fed-us-east-1-primary: 45% load (NORMAL)
└── Recommendation: Switch to backup node

Auto-Switch: ✅ Enabled (will switch if >90% for 2 min)
Manual Switch: Settings → Federation → Change Primary Node
```

**"Training new LoRAs is slow"**

*Optimize Training Resources*:
```
Training Performance Analysis:
├── Current Speed: 2.3 LoRAs per hour
├── Expected Speed: 4.1 LoRAs per hour
├── Bottleneck: Limited GPU access
└── Solution: Upgrade to GPU-enabled nodes

Cost: +$19.99/month for GPU acceleration
Benefit: 3x faster training, better quality LoRAs
```

### Data Integrity Issues

**"Sync conflicts keep happening"**

*Understanding Conflict Causes*:
```
Common Causes of Sync Conflicts:
├── Multiple devices training same LoRA simultaneously
├── Offline device comes back online with changes
├── Network interruptions during sync
└── Concurrent user corrections on different devices

Prevention:
├── Enable "Device Priority" in Settings
├── Use "Conflict-Free Mode" for critical LoRAs  
├── Schedule training during low-usage hours
└── Ensure stable internet during active use
```
