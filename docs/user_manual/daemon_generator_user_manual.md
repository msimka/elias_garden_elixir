**Sample Interaction Showing Personalization**:
```
You: "I'm struggling with prioritizing my tasks this week. Everything seems urgent."

Your Generic AI Assistant:
"Here are some general task prioritization methods: 1) Eisenhower Matrix 
2) ABC prioritization 3) MoSCoW method. Try categorizing your tasks..."

Your Personalized Daemon (Understanding YOUR Style):
"I know you prefer data-driven decisions with stakeholder input. Let me help 
you break this down systematically. First, let's identify which tasks have 
external dependencies - you mentioned last time that coordination delays are 
your biggest frustration. 

For each urgent task, I'll help you assess:
- Impact on your key Q1 objectives (the ones you outlined in January)
- Team dependencies (you work best with early stakeholder alignment)
- Your energy levels (you're most analytical in mornings)

Would you like me to walk through your current list using your usual 
pros-cons analysis approach? I can also factor in the timeline pressures 
you're managing, since I know you prefer thorough-but-efficient decisions."

[Your daemon remembers your patterns, preferences, and previous conversations]
```

### Advanced Personalization Features
