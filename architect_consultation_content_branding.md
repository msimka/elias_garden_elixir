## ðŸŽ¯ New Request: Content & Branding Infrastructure

Mike needs to establish a content and branding system for:

### Content Channels
- **Blog**: Written content and articles
- **YouTube**: Video content and tutorials  
- **Podcast**: Audio content and interviews
- **Merchandise**: T-shirts and branded materials

### Specific Need: Truisms & Taglines File
Mike wants to create a centralized file for:
- **Truisms**: Core philosophical statements about development, AI, and methodology
- **Taglines**: Memorable phrases for branding and marketing
- **T-shirt Content**: Quotable content that can go on merchandise
- **Video/Podcast Material**: Content that can be referenced across media

### Questions for Architect

1. **Folder Structure**: Where should the content/branding folder go in the ELIAS Garden project?
   - Should it be at root level `/Users/mikesimka/elias_garden_elixir/content_branding/`?
   - Should it be separate from the technical codebase?
   - How should we organize it for multi-channel content?

2. **File Organization**: How should we structure the truisms/taglines file?
   - Single file or multiple files by category?
   - What format (MD, YAML, JSON) for easy content management?
   - How to tag/categorize for different use cases (blog, video, merch)?

3. **Integration Strategy**: How should content connect to ELIAS system?
   - Should ULM (Learning Manager) help manage content creation?
   - Any automation opportunities for content generation/organization?
   - Version control and collaboration considerations?

4. **Proposed Structure** (for your review/modification):
   ```
   content_branding/
   â”œâ”€â”€ truisms_and_taglines.md     # Core quotable content
   â”œâ”€â”€ blog/                       # Blog content and drafts
   â”œâ”€â”€ video_content/              # YouTube scripts and materials  
   â”œâ”€â”€ podcast/                    # Podcast notes and transcripts
   â”œâ”€â”€ merchandise/                # T-shirt designs and product content
   â”œâ”€â”€ brand_guidelines/           # Brand standards and style guides
   â””â”€â”€ media_assets/               # Logos, images, brand materials
   ```

## Context: Why This Matters

This isn't a side project - it's core to the ELIAS brand and Mike's content strategy. The truisms and taglines will be foundational content that gets referenced across:

- Technical blog posts about ELIAS development
- YouTube videos explaining Tank Building methodology
- Podcast discussions about AI and distributed systems
- Merchandise that represents the ELIAS philosophy
- Documentation and marketing materials

## Request

Please advise on the optimal folder structure and organization approach for this content/branding system within the ELIAS Garden project ecosystem.

**Current Session Context**: We just completed ULM implementation and are ready to move to Phase 2, but Mike wants to establish the content infrastructure as part of the overall ELIAS ecosystem.
