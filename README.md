# ELIAS Brain Extension System

**The first AI brain extension that truly understands and enhances human creativity**

ELIAS combines μTransfer, GFlowNets, and mLoRA to create a personalized AI system that captures your thinking patterns across all creative domains, generates diverse ideas in your style, and scales efficiently to thousands of micro-specialized adapters per user.

## 🧠 What is ELIAS?

ELIAS is an always-available personalized AI that:
- **Captures Everything**: Voice/text input on phone, watch, earpiece
- **Understands You**: Learns your specific thinking patterns and terminology
- **Enhances Creativity**: Generates diverse ideas in your personal style
- **Scales Predictably**: μTransfer enables 99% cost reduction in scaling
- **Works Offline**: Local daemon provides instant responses

## 🔬 Core Innovation

### The Daemon Architecture Breakthrough
Instead of running heavy AI models constantly, ELIAS uses **LoRAs to generate personalized daemon code**:

1. **Train once daily**: Your micro-LoRA forest learns from daily interactions
2. **Generate custom code**: LoRAs create personalized daemon functions embodying your patterns
3. **Deploy locally**: Lightweight daemon runs 24/7 on your devices
4. **Instant responses**: <100ms local processing, feels like talking to yourself

### Three-Technology Integration

**μTransfer (μP)** - Hyperparameter Scaling
- Zero-shot transfer from small proxy models to production scale
- 99% reduction in tuning costs
- Mathematical guarantee of optimal hyperparameters

**GFlowNets** - Creative Diversity
- Samples diverse good ideas instead of single "optimal" solution
- Prevents creative stagnation and repetitive outputs
- Proportional sampling ensures quality + diversity

**mLoRA** - Concurrent Training
- Manages thousands of micro-LoRAs simultaneously
- 4x throughput improvement via unified memory management
- Hierarchical organization for efficient adapter navigation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Elixir 1.15+
- Erlang/OTP 26+
- Python 3.9+ (for AI components)
- CUDA-capable GPU (for training)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/elias_garden_elixir.git
cd elias_garden_elixir

# Install dependencies
mix deps.get

# Start ELIAS system
mix elias.start
```

### Quick Demo
```bash
# Convert research document
./mfc research_paper.pdf --type=paper

# Start brain extension daemon
mix elias.daemon.start --user=your_name

# Capture creative idea
echo "Movie idea about time travel and quantum physics" | mix elias.capture
```

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

### User's Micro-LoRA Forest
Each user gets thousands of specialized micro-LoRAs:

```
Creative Domains/
├── movie_ideas.μlora (GFlowNet architecture, μP scaled)
├── book_concepts.μlora (diverse architecture variant)
├── art_projects.μlora (user-specific architecture)
└── music_composition.μlora (efficiency-optimized)

Business Analysis/  
├── startup_evaluation.μlora
├── market_research.μlora
└── investment_analysis.μlora

Technical Thinking/
├── system_design.μlora  
├── debugging_patterns.μlora
└── code_optimization.μlora

Personal Organization/
├── daily_planning.μlora
├── goal_tracking.μlora
└── habit_formation.μlora
```

### Daily Update Cycle
```
1. User interactions → Pattern learning
2. Micro-LoRA updates → Concurrent training (mLoRA)  
3. Architecture discovery → GFlowNets exploration
