  primary_goal: "Build ELIAS systems that learn continuously and don't degrade"

    "Implement attention mechanisms for better processing",
    "Create hierarchical learning components", 
    "Build systems that improve over time"
  ]

## Core Problems We Need To Solve

### Problem 1: Continual Learning (From Sutton Paper)
  @ business_problem
    - AI systems degrade over time when learning new tasks
    - Models "forget" previous knowledge when updating
    - Production systems become less effective, not more effective
  
  @ technical_root_cause
    - Neural network weights grow too large over time
    - Many neurons become "dormant" (stop activating)
    - Network loses ability to adapt to new information
  
  @ elias_implementation_approach
    ```elixir
    # We need systems that:
    # 1. Monitor their own learning effectiveness
    # 2. Detect when they're losing plasticity
    # 3. Take corrective action automatically
    
    defmodule ELIAS.ContinualLearning do
      # Track network health metrics
      def monitor_plasticity(network_state) do
        dormant_units = count_inactive_units(network_state)
        weight_magnitudes = measure_weight_sizes(network_state)
        learning_rate = measure_recent_learning_progress(network_state)
        
        %{
          health_score: calculate_health(dormant_units, weight_magnitudes, learning_rate),
          needs_intervention: dormant_units > 0.5 or weight_magnitudes > threshold
        }
      end
      
      # Sutton's solution: Selective reinitialization
      def maintain_plasticity(network_state) do
        if needs_intervention?(network_state) do
          # Find least useful units and reinitialize them
          reinitialize_dormant_units(network_state)
        else
          network_state
        end
      end
    end
    ```

### Problem 2: Attention for Better Processing (From Uszkoreit Interview)
  @ business_problem
    - Sequential processing is slow and doesn't scale
    - Can't process long sequences effectively
    - Context gets lost in long documents/conversations
  
  @ key_insight
    - Instead of processing sequences step-by-step, process all positions simultaneously
    - Each position "attends to" (looks at) all other positions
    - This enables parallel processing and better long-range understanding
  
  @ elias_implementation_approach
    ```elixir
    defmodule ELIAS.AttentionMechanism do
      # Core attention: every input looks at every other input
      def self_attention(sequence) do
        sequence
        |> Enum.with_index()
        |> Enum.map(fn {current_item, i} ->
          # For each position, compute attention to all other positions
          attention_scores = compute_attention_scores(current_item, sequence)
          weighted_sum = weight_and_sum(sequence, attention_scores)
          {i, weighted_sum}
        end)
      end
      
      # This gives us better document understanding in our MFC pipeline
      def process_document_with_attention(document) do
        sentences = split_into_sentences(document)
        attended_sentences = self_attention(sentences)
        reconstruct_with_better_context(attended_sentences)
      end
    end
    ```

### Problem 3: Hierarchical Learning (From Oak Architecture)
  @ business_problem
    - Systems can't discover their own learning objectives
    - Everything has to be pre-programmed
    - No way to build up complex behaviors from simple ones
  
  @ key_insight
    - Agents should create their own subproblems (like children playing)
    - Learn "options" (ways of behaving) that can be combined
    - Build hierarchical knowledge from experience, not design
  
  @ elias_implementation_approach
    ```elixir
    defmodule ELIAS.HierarchicalLearning do
      # Discover interesting patterns and make them into subgoals
      def discover_subproblems(experience_data) do
        interesting_features = find_recurring_patterns(experience_data)
        
        interesting_features
        |> Enum.map(fn feature ->
          create_subproblem(feature, experience_data)
        end)
      end
      
      # Create "options" - policies for achieving specific goals
      def create_option(subproblem) do
        %ELIAS.Option{
          policy: learn_policy_for(subproblem),
          termination: learn_when_to_stop(subproblem),
          model: learn_what_happens_when_executed(subproblem)
        }
      end
      
      # This enables ELIAS managers to develop their own capabilities
      def manager_self_improvement(manager_state, experience) do
        new_subproblems = discover_subproblems(experience)
        new_options = Enum.map(new_subproblems, &create_option/1)
        
        %{manager_state | available_options: manager_state.available_options ++ new_options}
      end
    end
    ```

## Immediate ELIAS Applications

### 1. ULM (Universal Learning Manager) Improvements
  ```elixir
  # Apply continual learning to prevent knowledge degradation
  defmodule ELIAS.Manager.ULM.Enhanced do
    use ELIAS.ContinualLearning
    
    def process_new_document(state, document) do
      # Check if learning system is healthy
      health = monitor_plasticity(state.learning_networks)
      
      # Process document with attention mechanism
      processed_doc = ELIAS.AttentionMechanism.process_document_with_attention(document)
      
      # Update knowledge while maintaining plasticity
      new_state = update_knowledge(state, processed_doc)
      |> maintain_plasticity()
      
      {:ok, new_state}
    end
  end
  ```

### 2. UFM (Universal Federation Manager) Enhancements
  ```elixir
  # Apply hierarchical learning to workflow orchestration
  defmodule ELIAS.Manager.UFM.Enhanced do
    use ELIAS.HierarchicalLearning
    
    def optimize_workflows(state, workflow_history) do
      # Discover recurring workflow patterns
      subproblems = discover_subproblems(workflow_history)
      
      # Create reusable workflow "options"
      workflow_options = Enum.map(subproblems, &create_workflow_option/1)
      
      # Use these for better orchestration
      %{state | available_workflows: state.available_workflows ++ workflow_options}
    end
  end
  ```

### 3. MFC (Multi-Format Converter) Intelligence
  ```elixir
  # Apply attention to better document understanding
  defmodule MFC.CLI.Intelligent do
    def clean_and_process_content_v2(input_path, source_path, options) do
      {:ok, content} = File.read(input_path)
      
      # Extract content with attention-based understanding
      main_content = extract_content_with_attention(content)
      
      # Apply hierarchical cleaning (discover cleaning subproblems)
      cleaning_strategies = discover_cleaning_patterns(main_content, options.type)
      cleaned_content = apply_hierarchical_cleaning(main_content, cleaning_strategies)
      
      # Continually improve cleaning based on results
      update_cleaning_knowledge(cleaning_strategies, cleaned_content)
      
      processed_path = save_processed_content(cleaned_content, input_path)
      {:ok, processed_path}
    end
  end
  ```

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Continual Learning Foundation
  1. Add plasticity monitoring to existing ELIAS managers
  2. Implement selective reinitialization for learning components
  3. Create health metrics and alerts for learning degradation

### Phase 2: Attention Mechanisms  
  1. Enhance MFC document processing with attention
  2. Add attention-based context understanding to ULM
  3. Use attention for better cross-manager communication

### Phase 3: Hierarchical Learning
  1. Enable managers to discover their own subproblems
  2. Create option libraries for reusable behaviors
  3. Implement self-improving system capabilities

## Key Implementation Notes

### For Continual Learning:
- Monitor dormant units and weight magnitudes in real-time
- Implement automatic intervention when plasticity drops
- Log learning health metrics for system monitoring

### For Attention:
- Start with document processing in MFC
- Extend to inter-manager communication
- Use for long-context understanding in conversations

### For Hierarchical Learning:
- Begin with pattern discovery in workflow logs
- Create reusable "options" for common tasks
- Enable managers to self-improve over time

This gives us a concrete roadmap for implementing the key insights from these papers directly into ELIAS architecture.
