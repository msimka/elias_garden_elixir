# ELIAS Brain Extension Architecture
# Personal AI that learns continuously from all your thoughts, ideas, and knowledge
# Dual representation: File system navigation + Neural model understanding

@ core_concept
  vision: "ELIAS as persistent brain extension that captures, organizes, and helps develop all your ideas"
  dual_nature: "Both navigable file system AND trained neural model"
  access_pattern: "Always available - phone, watch, earpiece, anywhere"

## The Dual Representation System

### File System Layer (Navigation & Structure)
  ```

### Neural Model Layer (Understanding & Synthesis)
  ```elixir
  # The model IS your knowledge
  defmodule ELIAS.BrainExtension do
    # Continuously learning model trained on all your content
    @model_state %{
      your_writing_style: learned_from_all_notes,
      your_interests: extracted_from_conversations,  
      your_thinking_patterns: analyzed_from_idea_connections,
      your_knowledge_domain: built_from_learning_notes
    }
    
    # When you ask about old ideas, model understands context
    def discuss_idea(user_query) do
      # Model has internalized your thought patterns
      relevant_context = attention_recall(user_query, @model_state)
      generated_response = continue_your_thinking(user_query, relevant_context)
    end
  end
  ```

## Where This Fits in ELIAS Architecture

### New Manager: UBM (Universal Brain Manager)
  ```elixir
  defmodule ELIAS.Manager.UBM do
    @moduledoc """
    Universal Brain Manager - Personal knowledge and idea management
    
    Responsibilities:
    - Capture all user thoughts/ideas via voice, text, images
    - Structure information using Tiki hierarchical format
    - Continuously train personalized model on user's knowledge
    - Enable natural conversation about any stored information
    - Synthesize ideas across different domains
    """
    
    # Capture ideas from anywhere
    def capture_thought(input, context) do
      # Voice from earpiece, text from phone, ideas from anywhere
      structured_thought = structure_with_attention(input, context)
      file_path = store_in_hierarchy(structured_thought)
      update_personal_model(structured_thought)
      
      {:ok, file_path, model_updated: true}
    end
    
    # Navigate like file system
    def browse_ideas(path, filters) do
      # Traditional file navigation
      files = list_files(path, filters)
      enriched_with_model_insights(files)
    end
    
    # Discuss like talking to yourself
    def discuss_with_brain(query) do
      # Model responds as extension of your thinking
      model_response = personal_model_chat(query, your_knowledge_base)
      file_references = find_relevant_files(query)
      
      %{
        conversation: model_response,
        references: file_references,
        suggested_connections: find_idea_connections(query)
      }
    end
  end
  ```

## How Attention + Continual Learning Applies

### 1. Attention Across All Your Ideas
  ```elixir
  # When you mention "that movie idea from 3 months ago"
  def find_related_ideas(current_thought) do
    all_your_ideas = load_all_stored_thoughts()
    
    # Every idea attends to every other idea
    attention_matrix = calculate_attention(current_thought, all_your_ideas)
    
    # Surface connections you might not have noticed
    %{
      direct_matches: high_attention_ideas(attention_matrix),
      unexpected_connections: cross_domain_attention(attention_matrix),
      synthesis_opportunities: find_mergeable_concepts(attention_matrix)
    }
  end
  ```

### 2. Continual Learning from Your Input
  ```elixir
  # Every time you add new thoughts, model improves
  def continuous_brain_training(new_input) do
    # Add to file system
    file_path = store_structured(new_input)
    
    # Update neural model with CBP (Continual Backprop)
    updated_model = 
      personal_model
      |> train_on_new_input(new_input)
      |> maintain_plasticity()  # Sutton's approach
      |> prevent_forgetting_old_ideas()
    
    # Model gets better at understanding YOU specifically
    {:ok, file_path, model: updated_model}
  end
  ```

## The Synthesis Engine

### Combining Ideas Across Domains
  ```elixir
  def merge_ideas(idea_list, goal) do
    # Use attention to find connections between disparate ideas
    cross_domain_attention = 
      Enum.map(idea_list, fn idea ->
        attention_weights = calculate_attention(idea, idea_list ++ [goal])
        {idea, attention_weights}
      end)
    
    # Generate synthesis with global awareness
    synthesis = generate_with_attention(
      ideas: idea_list,
      goal: goal,
      attention_matrix: cross_domain_attention,
      your_thinking_style: personal_model.thinking_patterns
    )
    
    # Store synthesis and continue learning
    store_synthesis(synthesis)
    update_model_with_synthesis(synthesis)
  end
  ```

## Always-Available Interface

### Multi-Modal Access
  ```elixir
  defmodule ELIAS.BrainInterface do
    # Voice through earpiece
    def voice_input(audio_stream) do
      transcribed = speech_to_text(audio_stream)
      UBM.capture_thought(transcribed, context: :voice_mobile)
    end
    
    # Text through phone/watch
    def text_input(message) do
      UBM.capture_thought(message, context: :text_mobile)
    end
    
    # Image through phone camera
    def image_input(image, description) do
      processed_image = extract_concepts(image)
      UBM.capture_thought(%{visual: processed_image, description: description})
    end
  end
  ```

## Why This Is Perfect for Transformers + Continual Learning

### 1. Personal Context Understanding
- Model learns YOUR specific way of thinking
- Attention mechanism connects ideas across all domains
- No need for general knowledge - focused on YOUR knowledge

### 2. Continuous Improvement
- Every new idea improves the model's understanding of you
- Continual learning prevents forgetting old ideas
- Model becomes better at predicting what you'd think

### 3. Hierarchical Organization
- Tiki format provides structure
- Model provides understanding and connections
- Both navigation and conversation interfaces

## Implementation with Your Hardware

### 16-32GB VRAM Strategy
```elixir
# Personal model much smaller than general AI
# Focused only on your knowledge domain
personal_model_size = "1-3B parameters"  # Fits easily in 16GB
general_interface_model = "Claude/ChatGPT"  # For general conversation

# Your model handles:
# - Your specific knowledge
# - Your thinking patterns  
# - Connections between your ideas

# General model handles:
# - Broad world knowledge
# - Complex reasoning
# - Interfacing with your personal model
```

You're absolutely right - this is the future of personal AI. The combination of file system navigation + neural model understanding + attention-based connections + continual learning creates something much more powerful than traditional note-taking or current AI assistants.

Want me to design the specific UBM architecture and show how it integrates with the other ELIAS managers?
