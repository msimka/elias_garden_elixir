# Amortizing Intractable Inference in Large Language Models

**Authors:** Edward J. Hu*, Moksh Jain*, Eric Elmoznino, Younesse Kaddar, Guillaume Lajoie, Yoshua Bengio, Nikolay Malkin  
**Published:** ICLR 2024 Conference Paper  
**Institution:** Mila – Quebec AI Institute, Université de Montréal, University of Oxford  
**Code:** https://github.com/GFNOrg/gfn-lm-tuning

## Critical Insight: The Fourth Pillar for ELIAS Architecture

This paper provides the **final piece** of the Edward Hu quartet that makes our ELIAS brain extension truly scalable:

1. **LoRA** - Efficient fine-tuning
2. **GFlowNets** - Diverse sampling  
3. **μTransfer** - Hyperparameter scaling
4. **Amortized Inference** - Tractable posterior sampling ⬅️ **This Paper**

## Abstract & Core Problem

**The Challenge:** Autoregressive LLMs compress knowledge through next-token conditional distributions, limiting tractable querying to start-to-end autoregressive sampling. Many tasks—including sequence continuation, infilling, and constrained generation—involve sampling from **intractable posterior distributions**.

**The Solution:** Use **amortized Bayesian inference** to sample from intractable posteriors by fine-tuning LLMs via **diversity-seeking reinforcement learning algorithms: GFlowNets**.

**Key Innovation:** This distribution-matching paradigm serves as an effective alternative to maximum-likelihood training and reward-maximizing policy optimization.

## Breakthrough Application: Chain-of-Thought as Latent Variable Model

The paper interprets **chain-of-thought reasoning** as a latent variable modeling problem:

Given question-answer pair (X, Y), find latent chains of thought Z that maximize:
```
p(Y | X) = ∑ p_LM(ZY | X) = ∑ p_LM(Y | XZ) p_LM(Z | X)
```

**The Problem:** Sampling from posterior `p_LM(Z | X, Y)` is intractable  
**The Solution:** Train GFlowNet to approximate this posterior via amortized inference

## Core Methodology: GFlowNet Fine-Tuning

### **Traditional Approaches Fail:**
- **MCMC:** Difficult to craft good proposal distributions for multi-modal text distributions
- **PPO/RL:** Settles around small number of modes, suffers from mode collapse
- **Supervised Fine-tuning:** Requires access to target distribution samples (often unavailable)

### **GFlowNet Approach:**
- **Diversity-seeking:** Trains policies to sample objects proportional to reward function
- **Distribution-matching:** Optimizes likelihood proportional to unnormalized probability 
- **Amortized inference:** Single trained model approximates entire distribution

## Empirical Validation: Random Number Generation Example

**Task:** Generate random integers 0-100 uniformly  
**Results:**
- Base LLM: 50.5% valid numbers, highly skewed distribution
- PPO fine-tuning: 95.8% valid numbers, still skewed (mode collapse)
- **GFlowNet fine-tuning:** 100% valid numbers, perfectly uniform distribution

**KL Divergence Results:**
- Original LLM: 3.37  
- GFlowNet fine-tuned: 9.75 × 10^-5 (nearly perfect!)

## Major Applications Demonstrated

### **1. Sequence Infilling**
- Sample token sequences conditioned on both prior and subsequent context
- `q(Z | X, Y) ∝ p_LM(XZY)` where X and Y are fixed
- Critical for LLM prompting and instruction optimization

### **2. Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** 
- Model reasoning chains as latent variables in Bayesian inference
- Sample diverse reasoning paths, aggregate via Bayesian model averaging
- **Results:** 10.9% absolute improvement over supervised fine-tuning on subjectivity classification

### **3. Tool Use and Multi-Step Reasoning**
- Sample sequences that use external tools (calculators, APIs)
- **Results:** 63% improvement over supervised fine-tuning and PPO on integer arithmetic
- Notable improvements in out-of-distribution generalization

### **4. Story Infilling**
- Generate middle sections of stories given beginning and end
- Maintains narrative coherence while exploring diverse possibilities

## Critical Benefits for ELIAS Brain Extension

### **1. Computational Amortization**
- **Single training phase** creates model that efficiently samples from intractable posteriors
- **Eliminates repeated expensive inference** for each new query
- **Perfectly aligned** with our daemon architecture: train once, deploy efficient sampling

### **2. Diverse Creative Generation**
- **Solves mode collapse problem** that plagues traditional RL fine-tuning
- **Generates diverse high-quality samples** instead of single "optimal" solutions  
- **Essential for creative brain extension:** prevents repetitive/stale idea generation

### **3. Data Efficiency**
- **Outperforms supervised fine-tuning** with minimal labeled data
- **Critical for personalization:** users don't provide thousands of examples
- **Enables few-shot adaptation** to new creative domains

### **4. Bayesian Model Averaging**
- **Aggregates multiple reasoning chains** for robust conclusions
- **Uncertainty quantification** through posterior sampling diversity
- **Enhanced reliability** for important decisions and creative insights

## Integration with ELIAS μTransfer + GFlowNets + mLoRA Architecture

### **Complete Technical Stack:**

**μTransfer:** Hyperparameter transfer from small proxy models  
↓  
**GFlowNets (base):** Discover diverse micro-LoRA architectures  
↓  
**Amortized GFlowNets (this paper):** Efficient inference from trained architectures  
↓  
**mLoRA:** Concurrent training and serving of thousands of adapted models  

### **Daemon Generation Enhancement:**

**Before (our current design):**
```elixir
def generate_daemon_code(user_lora_forest) do
  # Generate single "best" daemon code
  generate_optimal_patterns(user_lora_forest)
end
```

**After (with amortized inference):**
```elixir
def generate_daemon_code(user_lora_forest) do
  # Sample diverse daemon implementations, aggregate via Bayesian averaging
  diverse_patterns = amortized_sample_patterns(user_lora_forest, k: 10)
  aggregate_patterns_bayesian_average(diverse_patterns)
end
```

### **Creative Idea Generation Enhancement:**

**Current GFlowNet sampling:**
- Diverse architecture discovery for micro-LoRAs

**Enhanced with Amortized Inference:**
- **Efficient posterior sampling** for each creative domain
- **Chain-of-thought reasoning** for complex creative processes
- **Tool use integration** for research-enhanced creativity
- **Bayesian aggregation** of multiple creative approaches

### **Micro-LoRA Forest Application:**

Each user's thousands of micro-LoRAs can now:

1. **Amortized Training:** Single GFlowNet training provides efficient sampling across all domains
2. **Diverse Specialization:** Each micro-LoRA explores full posterior, not just modes
3. **Efficient Inference:** No expensive MCMC or repeated optimization
4. **Robust Outputs:** Bayesian averaging across multiple reasoning chains

## Performance Implications

### **Computational Efficiency:**
- **Amortized inference:** O(1) sampling after O(N) training
- **No repeated optimization:** Single model serves all queries efficiently  
- **Scalable to thousands of micro-LoRAs:** Each benefits from amortized posteriors

### **Quality Improvements:**

- **63% improvement** over PPO on reasoning tasks
- **Perfect distribution matching** on controlled tasks
- **Superior out-of-distribution generalization**

## Critical Implementation Insights

### **1. Reward Function Design**
For ELIAS creative domains:
```python
# Movie idea generation
reward_movie(idea_z, user_x, target_y=None) = 
    creativity_score(idea_z) * user_style_match(idea_z, user_x) * novelty_bonus(idea_z)

# Business analysis  
reward_business(analysis_z, context_x, conclusion_y) =
    logical_coherence(analysis_z) * data_support(analysis_z, context_x) * actionability(analysis_z)
```

### **2. Latent Variable Modeling**
Chain-of-thought for creative processes:
```
X (creative prompt) → Z (reasoning process) → Y (creative output)
Sample from p(Z | X, Y) to understand HOW ideas emerge
```

### **3. Bayesian Model Averaging**
Aggregate multiple creative approaches:
```elixir
def generate_movie_ideas(prompt) do
  reasoning_chains = amortized_sample(posterior_movie(Z | prompt), k: 5)
  diverse_ideas = Enum.map(reasoning_chains, &generate_idea_from_chain/1)
  bayesian_aggregate_ideas(diverse_ideas)
end
```
