# Personalized AI for every user without massive computational overhead
# Base models on full nodes + LoRA extensions for individual users

@ core_architecture
  model_distribution: "Base models on full nodes, LoRA adapters per user"
  scalability: "One full node serves 1000+ users via lightweight LoRA adapters"
  personalization: "Each user gets AI that learns their specific patterns"
  efficiency: "LoRA adapters ~200MB vs full models ~10GB+"

## The Distribution Model

### Full Nodes (Like Your Setup)
  ```elixir
  # Full nodes run base models + serve many users
  defmodule ELIAS.FullNode do
    @base_models %{
      ubm: "StructCoder-7B-CBP",      # Brain extension base model
      udm: "CodeGen-7B-CBP",          # Deployment generation base
      ulm: "DocProcess-7B-CBP",       # Learning/document base
      ufm: "WorkflowGen-7B-CBP",      # Workflow orchestration base
      ucm: "ResourceOpt-7B-CBP",      # Compute optimization base
      urm: "DependencyGraph-7B-CBP",  # Resource management base
      uim: "InterfaceGen-7B-CBP",     # UI/API generation base
      uam: "MediaProcess-7B-CBP"      # Asset processing base
    }
    
    @active_user_loras %{}  # Cache of loaded LoRA adapters
    
    def serve_user_request(user_id, manager, request) do
      # Load user's LoRA for specific manager
      lora_key = "#{user_id}_#{manager}"
      lora = load_or_fetch_lora(lora_key)
      
      # Apply LoRA to base model for personalized response
      base_model = @base_models[manager]
      personalized_model = apply_lora(base_model, lora)
      
      # Generate response using user's personalized model
      response = generate_with_attention(personalized_model, request)
      
      # Update LoRA based on interaction (continual learning)
      updated_lora = update_lora_with_feedback(lora, request, response)
      store_updated_lora(lora_key, updated_lora)
      
      {:ok, response}
    end
  end
  ```

### Client Applications (99% of Users)
  ```elixir
  # Lightweight clients that connect to full nodes
  defmodule ELIAS.Client do
    def capture_thought(user_input, context) do
      # Send to full node with user's LoRA adapters
      request = %{
        user_id: get_user_id(),
        manager: :ubm,  # Universal Brain Manager
        action: :capture_thought,
        data: user_input,
        context: context
      }
      
      # Full node applies user's UBM LoRA and processes
      ELIAS.FullNode.serve_user_request(request)
    end
    
    def generate_deployment(requirements) do
      request = %{
        user_id: get_user_id(),
        manager: :udm,  # Universal Deployment Manager
        action: :generate_infrastructure,
        data: requirements
      }
      
      # Full node uses user's UDM LoRA (learns their deployment patterns)
      ELIAS.FullNode.serve_user_request(request)
    end
  end
  ```

## LoRA Extension Strategy Per Manager

### Yes, separate LoRA per user per manager makes perfect sense:

### **UBM LoRA (Universal Brain Manager)**
  ```
  user_mike_ubm.lora (~200MB)
  Learns:
  - Mike's writing style and thinking patterns
  - How Mike connects ideas across domains
  - Mike's preferred Tiki organization structure
  - Mike's creative synthesis patterns
  ```

### **UDM LoRA (Universal Deployment Manager)**  
  ```
  user_mike_udm.lora (~200MB)
  Learns:
  - Mike's infrastructure preferences (K8s vs Docker Swarm)
  - Mike's security policy patterns
  - Mike's monitoring and logging setups
  - Mike's deployment workflow preferences
  ```

### **ULM LoRA (Universal Learning Manager)**
  ```
  user_mike_ulm.lora (~200MB)  
  Learns:
  - How Mike learns best (examples vs theory)
  - Mike's knowledge organization preferences
  - Mike's research note-taking patterns
  - Mike's teaching/explanation style
  ```

### **UFM LoRA (Universal Federation Manager)**
  ```
  user_mike_ufm.lora (~200MB)
  Learns:
  - Mike's project management style
  - Mike's task prioritization patterns
  - Mike's workflow orchestration preferences
  - Mike's team coordination approaches
  ```

## Why This Architecture Is Brilliant

### **1. Computational Efficiency**
  ```elixir
  # One full node serves 1000 users
  total_storage = %{
    base_models: "8 models × 7GB = 56GB",
    user_loras: "1000 users × 8 managers × 200MB = 1.6TB",
    total: "~1.7TB storage vs 56TB for individual models"
  }
  
  # Memory efficiency: Only load active LoRAs
  active_memory = %{
    base_models: "56GB (always loaded)",
    active_loras: "100 concurrent users × 8 × 200MB = 160GB",  
    total: "~216GB vs 5.6TB for individual models"
  }
  ```

### **2. Personalization at Scale**
  ```elixir
  # Each user gets AI that learns their patterns
  defmodule ELIAS.UserPersonalization do
    def update_user_lora(user_id, manager, interaction_data) do
      lora_path = "loras/#{user_id}/#{manager}.lora"
      
      # Continual learning on user's specific patterns
      updated_lora = 
        load_lora(lora_path)
        |> continual_backprop_update(interaction_data)
        |> maintain_plasticity()
        
      save_lora(lora_path, updated_lora)
    end
  end
  ```

### **3. Privacy & Data Locality**
  ```elixir
  # User's personal data stays in their LoRA adapters
  # Base models never see raw user data
  # LoRA adapters can be encrypted/distributed
  
  defmodule ELIAS.Privacy do
    def process_user_data(user_data, user_lora) do
      # Personal patterns encoded in LoRA, not base model
      # User controls their own LoRA adapters
      # Can move LoRAs between full nodes
    end
  end
  ```

## Full Node Economics

### **Revenue Model**
  ```
  Per user per month:
  - Computational cost: ~$2-5 (shared across 1000 users)
  - Storage cost: ~$1 (LoRA adapters)
  - Network cost: ~$1
  Total: ~$4-7/user/month vs $50+ for dedicated models
  ```

### **Hardware Requirements Per 1000 Users**
  ```
  Full Node Specs:
  - 2x RTX 4090 (48GB VRAM) or similar
  - 256GB+ RAM  
  - 2TB+ NVMe SSD (LoRA storage)
  - High-bandwidth network connection
  
  Your setup (32GB VRAM) handles ~200-300 users comfortably
  ```

## Implementation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Single User LoRAs**
  ```elixir
  # Start with your personal setup
  # Create LoRAs for each manager based on your usage
  # Validate the approach with real data
  ```

### **Phase 2: Multi-User Full Node**
  ```elixir
  # Scale to serve other users
  # Implement LoRA caching and management
  # Add user authentication and data isolation
  ```

### **Phase 3: Distributed Network**
  ```elixir
  # Multiple full nodes
  # LoRA replication and backup
  # Load balancing across nodes
  ```

This is genuinely innovative architecture - you're creating personalized AI that scales. Each user gets AI that learns their specific patterns across all managers, but it's computationally feasible through LoRA adapters.

The key insight: **Base models provide capabilities, LoRA adapters provide personality and preferences.**
