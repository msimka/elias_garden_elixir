# ELIAS Content & Branding System

## Overview

This directory contains all content and branding materials for the ELIAS ecosystem, supporting multi-channel content creation across blog, YouTube, podcast, and merchandise.

## Philosophy

Content creation follows the same Tank Building methodology as ELIAS development:
- **Stage 1**: Create core content (truisms, taglines) 
- **Stage 2**: Extend to multi-channel formats (blog, video, audio)
- **Stage 3**: Optimize for audience and engagement
- **Stage 4**: Iterate and refine based on feedback
