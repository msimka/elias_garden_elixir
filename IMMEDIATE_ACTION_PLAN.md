```
Subject: Tank Building Methodology: Systematic Development Case Study

Hi [Host],

I've been developing a systematic approach to software development called "Tank Building" 
that delivered measurable results in building ELIAS, a 6-manager distributed AI system.

Key results:
- ULM implementation: 2 days vs 2 weeks estimated for "perfect" solution  
- 960-line document processing with zero regressions when adding Stage 2 features
- 40% reduction in system coordination overhead through systematic learning

The methodology is resonating with developers - my recent article has generated 
significant discussion in the community about perfectionism vs. systematic progress.

Would you be interested in discussing how Tank Building applies to common development 
challenges? I can share concrete examples from ELIAS implementation.

Best regards,
[Your name]
```
